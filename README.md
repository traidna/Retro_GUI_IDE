# Retro_GUI_IDE
Retro GUI IDE is a windows IDE and code building tool to build C programs or AppleSoft BASIC integrating provided libraries 
to easily create user interfaces on 6502 based computers such as Commodore 64/128/plus4 Apple II, Atari 400/800 and Oric Atmos.
It is the result of a project I started to participate in the RETROCHALLENGE Jan 2016

A starter guide - Retro GUI IDE User Notes.dox is now posted and should serve as a starter guide for Commodore64 and Apple IIe programming.
